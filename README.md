# Mastermind-Java

Welcome to my implementaiton of the famous mastermind game in the Java programming language.
This project is currently a work in progress.

## Description

Mastermind is a game composed of 8 different colors.
For this implementation it was composed of 8 different numbers. Pieces will be '0' '1' '2' '3' '4' '5' '6' '7'.
A secret code is then composed of 4 different pieces.

By default the player has 10 attempts to find the secret code.
After each input, the game indicates to the player the number of well placed pieces and the number of misplaced pieces.

If the player finds the code, he wins, and the game stops.
